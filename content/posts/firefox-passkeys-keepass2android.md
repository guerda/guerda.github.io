First thread message

    Because I found out via try & error: some pages don't find their [#passkeys](https://ruhr.social/tags/passkeys) with [#Firefox](https://ruhr.social/tags/Firefox) on [#Android](https://ruhr.social/tags/Android), which they just created. This happens if you have a password service as default like [#Keepass2Android](https://ruhr.social/tags/Keepass2Android). Creation works though. Chrome just works.

Easy solution: setup Google wallet as your default password service, then switch to Keepass2Android again and add Wallet as additional service.

Do this via settings password, default password service

This should be a blog post.

[\#passkey](https://ruhr.social/tags/passkey) [#KeePass](https://ruhr.social/tags/KeePass)
![Screenshot of Android settings for passwords, passkeys and accounts. Preferred service is set to Keepass2Android, below there's a button to edit this. 
Below there's a list of additional services, Google is selected there with a checkbox set to true.](https://media.ruhr.social/ruhr-social/media_attachments/files/114/002/236/580/892/481/original/24290d91901fa12d.png)
